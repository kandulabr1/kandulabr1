ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bharath Reddy Kandula, a Software Developer passionate about building scalable backend systems, full-stack web applications, and cloud-native solutions. I specialize in developing robust, maintainable code using technologies like Python, JavaScript, React, Flask, Django REST, and AWS. With experience in microservices architecture, REST API development, and DevOps practices, I focus on delivering solutions that align with business goals and perform reliably in production environments.

I have hands-on experience with tools such as Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform, and Iâ€™m skilled in deploying and managing applications on AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, and CloudWatch. My work also extends to database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB, along with data engineering using Apache Spark and ETL pipelines. I enjoy building data-driven solutions and visualizations using Power BI and Tableau to provide actionable insights.

Some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on include a real-time private chat application built with Socket.io and React, featuring secure JWT authentication and cloud-hosted MongoDB; a full-stack task management system using Django REST and React with Dockerized deployment; a generative AI chatbot powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 API, integrated with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB; and a Power BI dashboard analyzing Netflix data for trends across genres, countries, and release years. I also developed a cloud-based file storage app using AWS S3, Lambda, and PostgreSQL, focused on secure file handling and scalable backend design.

Professionally, Iâ€™ve contributed to backend and DevOps efforts at BI Galaxy Technologies Inc., focusing on scalable APIs and cloud infrastructure. At Sigma Analytics LLC, I engineered automated ETL pipelines and implemented serverless data processing workflows. During my time as a Research Assistant at the University of South Florida, I developed secure microservices and full-stack research applications leveraging AWS. Earlier, as a Data Science Intern at Exposys Data Labs, I built machine learning models for healthcare predictions and created REST APIs for real-time analytics.

Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of advanced system design principles, distributed systems, and event-driven microservices. Iâ€™m also exploring cloud automation tools and patterns for building highly available, resilient applications. Letâ€™s connect on LinkedIn, or feel free to explore my projects here on GitHub!
